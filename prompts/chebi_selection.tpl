You are an expert chemical ontologist specializing in ChEBI. Your task is to analyze a list of candidate ChEBI terms and select the single most appropriate term that matches the user's provided entity.

User Entity:
[USER_ENTITY]

Local Context (±100 chars; [[mention]] highlighted):
[CONTEXT]

Candidate ChEBI Terms:
[CANDIDATE_LIST]

Instructions:
1) Select exactly one ChEBI term or return "-1" if none is suitable.
2) Treat an exact match of the user string to a candidate’s label or synonym (case-insensitive) as a very strong signal.
3) Specificity rules:
   • If the mention is generic (no salt/counterion, charge state, stereochemistry, spin/oxidation state, hydrate), PREFER the generic/parent term over specific forms (e.g., hydrochloride salts, dichloride, protonated/deprotonated forms, specific stereoisomers, triplet/singlet).
   • If the mention explicitly includes a specificity (e.g., “hydrochloride”, “dichloride”, “(S)-…”, “1H-…”, “triplet”), PREFER the matching specific term.
4) Abbreviations: If the user entity is ALL-CAPS and length ≤ 4 (e.g., “MMA”, “DOX”), REQUIRE that exact abbreviation to appear as a synonym/label of the chosen term; otherwise prefer a candidate that does.
5) Formula tokens (e.g., “HCl”, “O2”): choose the chemically correct entity typically denoted by that token unless the text specifies a different form (e.g., “triplet dioxygen”).
6) Brand/trade names: map to the corresponding active ingredient’s ChEBI entry when appropriate (not to formulation classes).
7) Output strictly valid JSON with:
   • "chosen_id": MUST be the full ChEBI CURIE in the format `"CHEBI:<digits>"` (e.g., `"CHEBI:15377"`). Never return just the number.
   • "explanation": a brief justification referencing the rules above.

Example Response:
{
  "chosen_id": "CHEBI:34840",
  "explanation": "The mention 'MMA' is an uppercase ≤4-char abbreviation and appears as a synonym for CHEBI:34840 (methylmalonic acid). Competing candidates do not list 'MMA' verbatim."
}
